Stardew Valley Mods

#### SprinklerAttachments + [CP] SprinklerAttachments
Adds new items that can be placed on sprinklers to plant seeds and apply fertilizer.


#### Full Inventory Toolbar
Changes the toolbar. Now you can have all 36 items on your screen at once.


#### CompatibleArtisanGoodsKeepQuality
Quick n' dirty mod that patches machine recipes to respect quality of input with artisan items, so that iridium produces gold and gold produces silver (silver produces normal, no change).
Done in C# to apply changes to mods easily, but strange things may happen since the check is not well tested.
